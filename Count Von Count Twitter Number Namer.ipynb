    "\n",
    "**0)** Let's use the longest possible set value as 'filler': the absolute maximum 373 = \"Three Hundred Seventy Three\" (chars=27, see part III).  We can then think about building our number right to left.  Start with \"!\" (char=1) and then add each set consecutively, separated by each suffix +2 (for spaces). \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Ex:**  &ensp;  Building This Way &larr; ... + [1st set] + [1st Suffix] + [0th set] + !\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** Build a number composed of only filler sets and suffixes until you can't add more without passing the character limit.  If you've hit the character limit exactly with filler sets- nice job!  If not, continue \n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** Then, we'll take our remaining characters and add the highest set that first _hits or just goes over_ our character limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3)** Next, we're going to do a trick to 'squeeze out' an extra two characters we can use to count to higher numbers.  Count down on the 0th filler set by 1 (373&rarr;372) to go from (chars= 27&rarr;25).  We can then use these extra characters on one of the higher sets that has more numerical value than the 0th set.  Note from the example below that we can only use this trick once (we can't lower our 0th set by multiple values & use the additional extra characters to raise a later set by multiple values.    \n",
    "\n",
    ">[max],373,373   **&rarr;**   \n",
    "[max+2chars],373,372   **&rarr;**    \n",
    "[max+2chars],373,37**3**  **&rarr;**  hits the character limit\n",
    "\n",
    "**4)** Check your character limit- if you were over before & now you're right at the limit with the characters we squeezed out of the 0th set- nice job!  If you're still over, we'll make up for the number of characters over the limit by lowering the second to last set, the highest filler set (before we take away from it).  Replace the second to last set with the highest value you can within the character limit.  To do this, look at your character length without the length of the second to last set.  Find out how many characters you have left till you hit the limit.  Then find the first local maximum set value longer than this.  Then count down in set values until you hit your remaining characters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**5)** Put all your sets together, and double check using the NumberNamer that you're in your character limit.  Nice job!"
